<p>This makes me pretty sad, because I think algorithms can also be really beautiful! My interest in algorithmic composition with SuperCollider and TidalCycles has started to creep into my jazz composition as well. On a recent trip to Lisbon, Portugal, where I visited a friend/partner and tanked a bit of Vitamin D, I was stunned by the beauty of the ceramic tiles everywhere, and their algorithmic nature.</p>
<p>This trip to Portugal, and my research into algorithmic music, inspired a &ldquo;the Algorithm Project&rdquo;. (to do: link). With my new band, the Ceramic Tiles, ft. Jonas Westergaard, <a href="https://www.peter-ehwald.net/">Peter Ehwald</a> and <a href="https://www.max-stadtfeld.de/">Max Stadtfeld</a>, I went into the studio to investigate what roles algorithms can play in contemporary jazz. I&rsquo;m keen to continue to explore this into the future with these wonderful musicians!</p>
