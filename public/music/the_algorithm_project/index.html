After a few years of learning about electroacoustic music, algorithmic composition and live coding, I decided to try to apply some of these concepts to jazz composition and see what happens.</p>
<p>The process was basically as follows:</p>
<p>I wrote a bunch of music. About half the pieces started as algorithms in SuperCollider that I then &ldquo;translated&rdquo; into musical notation for the musicians. The other half of the pieces were a bit more abstract - I thought about the musicians in my bands as bits of code that I&rsquo;d written, and used a few different algorithmic strategies to compose for them.</p>
<p>In December, I went into the studio with two bands - one, with my quartet Redbank [link], and then with a new quartet - if I&rsquo;m doing a new project, I may as well use it as an excuse to start a new band! This was the first time I&rsquo;d played with Jonas, and that Jonas, Max and Peter had played with each other at all. I sent a few of the charts beforehand, but most of the pieces I just brought with me on the day. I wanted to capture the same spontaneity and riskyness that comes with a live coding gig - anything could go wrong, and that&rsquo;s not only ok but somehow also cool!</p>
<p>We recorded in the beautiful <a href="http://www.studio-zentrifuge.de/">Zentrifuge</a> studio in Berlin with the amazing Tito Knapp. I can&rsquo;t recommend this enough: Zentrifuge sounds great, it&rsquo;s affordable. Tito&rsquo;s mixing and mastering is incredibly fast and sounds (to my ears) just fantastic. My dear friend <a href="https://sandrareyesfilms.wordpress.com/">Sandra Reyes</a> came along and filmed both days. Sandra is a bit of a video genius if you ask me, check her out. (links to all people here).</p>
