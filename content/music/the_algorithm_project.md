title: "The Algorithm Project"

In November and December 2021 I worked on what I've decided to call "The Algorithm Project". After a few years of learning about electroacoustic music, algorithmic composition and live coding, I decided to try to apply some of these concepts to jazz composition and see what happens.

The process was basically as follows:

I wrote a bunch of music. About half the pieces started as algorithms in SuperCollider that I then "translated" into musical notation for the musicians. The other half of the pieces were a bit more abstract - I thought about the musicians in my bands as bits of code that I'd written, and used a few different algorithmic strategies to compose for them.

In December, I went into the studio with two bands - one, with my quartet Redbank [link], and then with a new quartet - if I'm doing a new project, I may as well use it as an excuse to start a new band! This was the first time I'd played with Jonas, and that Jonas, Max and Peter had played with each other at all. I sent a few of the charts beforehand, but most of the pieces I just brought with me on the day. I wanted to capture the same spontaneity and riskyness that comes with a live coding gig - anything could go wrong, and that's not only ok but somehow also cool!

We recorded in the beautiful [Zentrifuge](http://www.studio-zentrifuge.de/) studio in Berlin with the amazing Tito Knapp. I can't recommend this enough: Zentrifuge sounds great, it's affordable. Tito's mixing and mastering is incredibly fast and sounds (to my ears) just fantastic. My dear friend [Sandra Reyes](https://sandrareyesfilms.wordpress.com/) came along and filmed both days. Sandra is a bit of a video genius if you ask me, check her out. (links to all people here).
