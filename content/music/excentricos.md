Los Excéntricos is a new band which is authentically, quintessentially Weimar – musicians from Germany, Cuba, Colombia, Brazil and Australia working together, combining a wealth of traditional knowledge to develop their own style together. Literally ‘the Eccentrics’ in Spanish, Los Excéntricos play an extremely varied mixture of groove-based, highly polyrhythmic music, with nods to music from Cuba, Mali and Peru, as well as the work of jazz musicians who have been doing just that for a bit longer.
