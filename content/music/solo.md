I started performing solo guitar seriously in 2014, after a number of duo collaborations with dancers and artists. In 2018, I performed live for 90 minutes at the premiere Sleep Concert in Weimar, Germany, a challenging but rewarding experience both musically and psychologically.  Iâ€™ve has continued to perform improvised and semi-improvised solo concerts in Weimar, Germany, including Sleep Concerts for two hours in January 2019 and September 2020.
