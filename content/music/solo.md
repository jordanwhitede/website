I started performing solo guitar seriously in 2014, after a number of duo collaborations with dancers and artists. In 2018, I performed live for 90 minutes at the premiere Sleep Concert in Weimar, Germany, a challenging but rewarding experience both musically and psychologically.  Iâ€™ve has continued to perform improvised and semi-improvised solo concerts in Weimar, Germany, including Sleep Concerts for two hours in January 2019 and September 2020. I'm currently working on electronic music and solo guitar in my project "Who Needs Friends?"
